# Data Abstraction in Gatsby Themes

This is a proof-of concept to play around with the idea of data abstraction in Gatsby.

It takes advantage of [Gatsby themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-03-11-gatsby-themes-roadmap/) and [schema customization](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-03-04-new-schema-customization/) to enable sites that require no code whatsoever, and to enable theme developers to create components and styles that donâ€™t rely on data.
